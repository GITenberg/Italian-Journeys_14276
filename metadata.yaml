description: CLASSIC TRAVEL WRITING. When Abraham Lincoln appointed William Dean Howells
  Consul to Venice, the young writer embarked on a journey that would leave an indelible
  impression on his life and work. Howells lived in Italy for four years, from 1861,
  during the pivotal and tumultuous period of Italian reunification. Italian Journeys,
  Howell's engrossing memoir of this time, describes his adventures across the country
  - from Genoa, a hotbed of nationalistic fervour and the city from which Garibaldi
  had led the Expedition of the Thousand only a year before; to the cultural and political
  powerhouse of Naples, which had only just become part of the Kingdom of Italy and
  from there to Rome, focus for the hopes of a fractured country.
